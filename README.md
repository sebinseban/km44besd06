##2.ESCAPE SEQUENCES (28/12/2021)
1) notedown and practice all escape sequences
2) practice skip characters
3) Read a 4 digit integer number into a variable ( eg., 4596) and print it in the below format using escape sequences:

op:  
4596
459
45
4

##1.VARIABLES (27/12/2021)

1) List out the format specifiers for different datatypes.
2) Create a variable for every datatype and try scanf and printf on those variables.
3)"Calculation of simple interest.
        steps: 
        a)declare 2 integer variables p and n to represent principle and duration in months respectively.
        b)declare a floating point variable r to represent rate of interest.
        c)declare a floating point variable si to store simple interest after calculation.
        d)declare a float variable m to represent time duration in years.
        e)print the following indicative message using printf
        ""please enter principle,time in months and rate of interest""
        f)read the values of p ,n and r using scanf.
        g)devide n by 12.0 using / symbol and store the result in m, to convert time duration from months to years.
        Hint : m = n / 12.0;
        h)calculate simple interest using the below formula and store in si variable.
        si = p * m * r / 100;
        i) print si value to the user using printf."

4)calculation of average of 4 numbers
5)calculation of area and perimeter of rectangle,square and circle by taking the appropriate measurement as input.
6)if sale price and profit of n items is given as input, find the cost price of 1 item.

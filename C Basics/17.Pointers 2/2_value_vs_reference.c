//Note down the differences between Call by Value and Call by Reference and when to use what.

Call by Value
* Only data copies are made in the calling function
* Can only return 1 value from a function by this method

Call by Reference
* Directly accessing the address of the variable
* Can return multiple variables without using return keyword
